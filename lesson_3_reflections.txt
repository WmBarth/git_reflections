When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
1) When working on a project with others.
2) When working on a project from multiple sites/computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
It's possible that the remote has commits or data that are not ready for review or testing.  For example, if I'm working with others on a project, they may have pushed their commits because they're traveling and want to get to it later from another site.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A branch is a child that initiates a new line of commits, moving off a main line or history of commits.  It resides in one location.  A fork exists on git hub.  It separates the commit history into a new history.  This allows a user to make changes and commits without affecting other commit histories. A clone copies everything in a repository from one location to another.  A repository can be cloned (copied) within the same machine or from one machine to another.  It differs from a fork in that it does not record or relate to the original author of the repository.It also differs because it can be done outside of git hub, whereas a fork is something that is part of git hub.
